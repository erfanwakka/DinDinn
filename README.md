This repo contains both problem solving and main project.
I'm not a fan of reactive programming so I did best to do it although if there is a chance I would like to go deep with it.
Part of question said to use your own network layer but Moya itself is a network layer so I prefered to use that.
Also I have my own network layer at this repo if you wanna check https://github.com/erfanwakka/NetworkLayer
